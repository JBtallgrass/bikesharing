# Background



      Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Deliverables
            * Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
            * Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
            * Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

# Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format (20 points)

# Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis (50 points)
